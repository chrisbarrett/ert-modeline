Run ERT tests and show the results in the modeline.

## Description

This is a minor mode that will run ERT tests in the background whenever you save an Elisp buffer or evaluate an expression. The results are displayed in the modeline, so you will know immediately if you have introduced a breaking change.

The mode will make a decent attempt to search for test files in your project. If you have a standard project layout it should work without any configuration, but you can customize `ertml-setup-commands`  if you need to do something special.
